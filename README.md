üîê Simple Keylogger

During my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy Infotech, I had the opportunity to develop a basic yet functional keylogger program as part of my learning journey. This project aimed to introduce me to the fundamentals of keylogging and logging keystrokes effectively.

Description:
The Simple Keylogger project is a Python program that records and logs keystrokes on a computer system. It leverages the keyboard module to capture keyboard events and saves them to a text file with a timestamp. The user interface is minimal, focusing on functionality rather than elaborate design.

Ethical Considerations:
It's crucial to emphasize the ethical considerations and permissions associated with keylogger projects. Throughout this internship project, I remained mindful of ethical guidelines and sought appropriate permissions before implementing any monitoring tools.

Learning Outcomes:
This project provided me with valuable insights into cybersecurity concepts such as keylogging, data logging, and user monitoring. Additionally, it enhanced my programming skills in Python and familiarized me with the ethical considerations surrounding cybersecurity practices.

Usage and Considerations:
While keyloggers can serve legitimate purposes such as parental controls or employee monitoring, it's essential to use them responsibly and with explicit consent. As such, this project serves as a foundational exercise in understanding the ethical implications of cybersecurity tools and practices.
